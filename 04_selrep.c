/*
 * Selective Repeat Protocol Implementation
 *
 * This program demonstrates the implementation of the Selective Repeat protocol
 * for reliable data transfer over a network. It uses asynchronous I/O, support
 * for timeouts, and non-blocking I/O for efficient packet handling.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - main: Initialization and runs the application
 * - myio: Handles packet receiving
 * - mytimer: Handles the timeouts

	The caller should specify the number of items in the fds array in nfds.

	The field fd contains a file descriptor for an open file.  If this field is negative, then the corre‐

	ignoring a file descriptor for a single poll() call: simply negate the fd field.  Note, however, that
	this technique can't be used to ignore file descriptor 0.)

	The field events is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the events the  application  is  inter‐
	ested  in  for  the  file descriptor fd.  This field may be specified as zero, in which case the only
	events that can be returned in revents are POLLHUP, POLLERR, and POLLNVAL (see below).

	The field revents is an output parameter,  filled  by  the  kernel  with  the  events  that  actually
	occurred.   The  bits returned in revents can include any of those specified in events, or one of the
	values POLLERR, POLLHUP, or POLLNVAL.  (These three bits are meaningless in  the  events  field,  and
	will be set in the revents field whenever the corresponding condition is true.)

	If  none  of  the  events requested (and no error) has occurred for any of the file descriptors, then
	poll() blocks until one of the events occurs.

	fcntl - manipulate file descriptor
	Usage: int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... // arg //);
	
	fcntl() performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor fd.  The operation
	is determined by cmd.

	fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this argument is required is  determined
	by  cmd.   The required argument type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most cases,
	the required type is int, and we identify the argument using the name arg), or void is  specified  if
	the argument is not required.

	Managing signals
	F_GETOWN, F_SETOWN, F_GETOWN_EX, F_SETOWN_EX, F_GETSIG and F_SETSIG are used to manage I/O availability signals:

	F_SETOWN (int)
		Set  the  process ID or process group ID that will receive SIGIO and SIGURG signals for events
		on file descriptor fd to the ID given in arg.  A process ID is specified as a positive  value;
		a process group ID is specified as a negative value.  Most commonly, the calling process spec‐
		ifies itself as the owner (that is, arg is specified as getpid(2)).

		If you set the O_ASYNC status flag on a file  descriptor  by  using  the  F_SETFL  command  of
		fcntl(),  a  SIGIO  signal  is  sent  whenever  input  or output becomes possible on that file
		descriptor.  F_SETSIG can be used to obtain delivery of a signal other than  SIGIO.   If  this
		permission check fails, then the signal is silently discarded.

		Sending  a  signal  to  the owner process (group) specified by F_SETOWN is subject to the same
		permissions checks as are described for kill(2), where the sending process  is  the  one  that
		employs F_SETOWN (but see BUGS below).

		If  the  file  descriptor fd refers to a socket, F_SETOWN also selects the recipient of SIGURG
		signals that are delivered when out-of-band data arrives on that socket.  (SIGURG is  sent  in
		any situation where select(2) would report the socket as having an "exceptional condition".)

	File status flags
	Each  open  file description has certain associated status flags, initialized by open(2) and possibly
	modified by fcntl().  Duplicated file descriptors (made with dup(2), fcntl(F_DUPFD),  fork(2),  etc.)
	refer to the same open file description, and thus share the same file status flags.

	F_GETFL (void)
		Get the file access mode and the file status flags; arg is ignored.

    flags = fcntl(s, F_GETFL); // Get the file status flags of the socket: check if the socket has been set up correctly
    
	if (flags == -1) { // if an error occured in setting up the socket
		perror("Error in F_SETOWN: fcntl-F_GETFL returned -1"); 
		return 1;
	}

	/*
	File status flag
	F_SETFL (int)

		File access mode (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) and file creation flags (i.e., O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY,  O_TRUNC) in arg are ignored.   
		On Linux this command can change only the O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_DIRECT, O_NOATIME, and O_NONBLOCK flags.  
		It is not possible to change the O_DSYNC  and  O_SYNC  flags;  see BUGS, below.

	The sigaction() system call is used to change the action taken by a process on receipt of a specific signal.

	The sigaction structure is defined as something like:
		struct sigaction {
			void     	(*sa_handler)(int);
			void     	(*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
			sigset_t   	sa_mask;
			int        	sa_flags;
			void     	(*sa_restorer)(void);
		};

	The sa_restorer field is not intended for application use.

	sa_handler specifies the action to be associated with signum and may be SIG_DFL for the default action, SIG_IGN to ignore this signal, or a pointer to a signal handling function.  
	This function receives the signal number as its only argument.

	sa_mask  specifies  a  mask  of  signals which should be blocked (i.e., added to the signal mask of the thread in which the signal  handler  is invoked) during execution of the signal handler.  
	In addition, the signal which triggered the handler will be blocked, unless the SA_NODEFER flag is used.

	sa_flags specifies a set of flags which modify the behavior of the signal.

	The siginfo_t argument to sa_sigaction is a struct with  the  following fields: 
			siginfo_t {
			int	si_signo;	// Signal number 
			int si_errno;	// An errno value 
			int si_code;	// Signal code 
			... (see "man sigaction" for more)
