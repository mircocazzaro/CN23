The program esame.c is the copy of /CN21/congctrl.c program, that processes the
incoming Web requests, implementing the HTTP / TCP / IP / Ethernet stack, equipped with the
congestion control basic mechanism. 

A Web browser can connect to it through the URL
http://88.80.187.84:<port>/file.jpg (the file.jpg is in your home directories)
where the <port>1 is the one specified in the first command line parameter argv[1] and the
file.jpg is in your home directories.

The esame.c program estimates the Round Trip Time by matching the transmission time of
segments (only if transmitted once) with the corresponding acknowledge time, using the time
difference as Round Trip Time Measurement (RTTM) useful for the prediction.

Section 3 of the RFC 1323 introduced an enhancement of the RTTM by adding a new TCP header
options field (Timestamp), in which each TCP peer provides the other peer with the following data:
a) its own updated local timestamp sample
b) the latest significant peerâ€™s timestamp sample previously received, defined according to the
specific logic described in Paragraph 3.4

You are requested to implement and test this mechanism in the esame.c program to make it
properly send the additional samples requested and properly use the additional received sample.

In the top of your source program, please, add the following contents in a /*comment section*/ :
1) Describe the point of the program where you apply the changes
2) Comment the logic suggested by the RFC 1323, Section 3.
3) Report the results of the test comparing the execution of the original and of the modified
programs
