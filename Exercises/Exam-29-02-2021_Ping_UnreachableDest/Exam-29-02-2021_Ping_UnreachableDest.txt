Add to the program ping.c the capability of processing the "unreachable destination" ICMP message type reported in the RFC 792 (see next page), in addition to the usual ICMP "echo reply" messages. 
The “unreachable destination” message can be generated by a router in the network if, while processing an IP datagram, it realizes that it is destined for an address that cannot be reached.  In this case the router:

1. discards that IP packet (i.e. it erases it without forwarding it to any further hop).

2. creates the ICMP "unreachable destination" message

3. sends the ICMP message to the node that generated the IP packet with no reachable destination to warn it that it has thrown the packet away.

The modified program should 
a) report that the echo request has not reached the destination and 
b) specify the IP address of the router that discarded the echo request. 

To test the program, make it send an "echo request" to an unreachable address (e.g. 216.51.250.1 ) to obtain a "Destination Unreachable" message and identify the ip address of the node that has generated the message.

In the top of your source program, add the following contents:
    1) Describe the point of the program where you apply the changes
    2) Define the logic of the changes
    3) Report the results of the test 
OR
    1) RETIRED, if you want to cancel the exam. 


Advanced feature to implement for skillful students:
Make the program able to report how many nodes the discarded packet has traversed before being discarded.
